## Digital editions' competitive audit
### Description
This work aims to define a series of reference models that would serve as a guide to the design and development of the [National Edition of Aldo Moro's works](https://aldomorodigitale.unibo.it/). These models have been defined through a benchmarking process that is organized as follows:

* content analysis on a sample of 30 digital editions, evaluated on the basis of certain criteria defined in [Sahle (2014)](https://www.i-d-e.de/publikationen/weitereschriften/criteria-version-1-1/);
* processing of the data gathered as a result of the content analysis, so as to extract the relevant information, and visualize it;
* review of the data processing results and consideration of the models that can be used as reference.
